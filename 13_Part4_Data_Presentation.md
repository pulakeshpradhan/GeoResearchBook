# Chapter 4.1: Data Presentation

A good map speaks 1000 words. A bad map confuses 1000 people.

## Cartographic Principles for Research

1. **North Arrow & Scale Bar**: Mandatory.
2. **Clear Legend**: Don't use "0-1" for NDVI. Use "Low Vegetation" to "Dense Forest".
3. **Color Blindness**: Avoid "Red-Green" ramps. Use "Viridis" or "Orange-Blue".
4. **Grid Lines**: Put latitude/longitude ticks on the edges.

## Charts and Graphs

1. **Bar Charts**: For categorical data (e.g., Forest Area in 2000 vs 2020).
2. **Line Charts**: For trends (e.g., Temperature changes jan-Dec).
3. **Scatter Plots**: For correlations (e.g., Does LST increase as NDVI decreases?).
    * *R-Square Value*: Always put the R² value on a scatter plot to show statistical strength.
