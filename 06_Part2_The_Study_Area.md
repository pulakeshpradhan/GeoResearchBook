Geography is the study of *place*. You must describe your place well.

## Identifying Components

1. **Location**:
    * Latitude and Longitude extent.
    * Administrative hierarchy (District, State, Country).
    * "The study area lies between 20°N to 22°N latitudes..."
2. **Physiography**:
    * Terrain (Hilly, Flat, Coastal).
    * Identify major rivers or mountains.
3. **Climate**:
    * Köppen classification (e.g., "Tropical Monsoon").
    * Min/Max Temperature and Annual Rainfall.
4. **Socio-Economic Profile**:
    * Population density (Census 2011).
    * Major economic activities (Agriculture vs. Industrial).

## Making the Study Area Map

A good map is mandatory. It should have:

1. **Inset Map**: Showing where the district is inside the State/Country.
2. **The Main Map**: Showing the boundary.
3. **Grid**: Lat/Long ticks.
4. **Elements**: North Arrow, Scale Bar, Legend.
