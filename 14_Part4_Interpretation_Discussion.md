# Chapter 4.2: Interpretation and Discussion

The goal of research is not just to produce a map, but to produce **Meaning**.

## Statistical Significance ($p$-value)

In scientific writing, you cannot simply say "A implies B". You must prove it.

* **Correlation Coefficient ($r$)**: Measures strength of relationship (-1 to +1).
* **Determination Coefficient ($R^2$)**: How much variation is explained? ($R^2 = 0.8$ means 80% of temperature variation is explained by vegetation).
* **$p$-value**: Probability that the result is random. We typically look for $p < 0.05$ (95% confidence).

## Correlation vs. Causation

* **Correlation**: "Areas with more concrete are hotter." (Observed relationship).
* **Causation**: "Concrete absorbs solar radiation and re-emits it, *causing* heat." (Physical mechanism).
* *Warning*: Do not claim causation without theoretical backing.

## Structuring the Discussion

1. **Summarize Key Findings**: "The analysis successfully mapped the extent of the 2022 floods, revealing that 1500 sq km of agricultural land was inundated."
2. **Contextualize with Literature**:
    * *Agreement*: "These results corroborate the findings of Ahmed (2023), who observed similar patterns in the downstream delta."
    * *Disagreement*: "Contary to early predictions by Models (2020), the flood extent was significantly larger, likely due to the unpredicted breach of the embankment."
3. **Mechanism Explanation**: *Why* did it happen? "The high inundation in Sector 4 can be attributed to the low elevation (depression zone) identified in the DEM analysis."
4. **Limitations (Critical Self-Reflection)**:
    * "The use of optical imagery (Sentinel-2) limited the post-flood assessment due to persistent cloud cover. Future studies should incorporate SAR data."
    * "The pixel size of 30m (Landsat) may not capture micro-scale urban thermal variations."

## Conclusion

A strong conclusion answers the "So What?".

* **Implications**: "The strong negative correlation between NDVI and LST suggests that city planners must prioritize green corridors to mitigate heat stress."
* **Future Scope**: "Future research could employ drone-based thermal mapping for building-level analysis."
