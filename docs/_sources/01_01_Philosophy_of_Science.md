# Chapter 1.1: Philosophy of Geographic Research

## 1. Introduction: Thinking Like a Researcher

Before we touch a satellite image or write a survey, we must understand the *nature* of the knowledge we are seeking. This is called the "Philosophy of Science". In Geography, a field that bridges the physical (Earth) and social (Human) worlds, understanding your philosophical stance is critical.

## 2. The Three Pillars

Every research study is built on three invisible pillars:

1. **Ontology** (What is reality?)
2. **Epistemology** (How can we know it?)
3. **Methodology** (How do we measure it?)

### 2.1 Ontology: The Nature of Reality

* **Realism**: "There is a single, objective reality out there."
  * *Example*: The temperature of Delhi is a physical fact. It exists whether we measure it or not.
  * *Relevance*: Most Physical Geography and Remote Sensing falls here.
* **Relativism**: "Reality is constructed by the observer."
  * *Example*: "Poverty" is not a physical object; it is a definition created by society. Different people experience it differently.
  * *Relevance*: Human Geography, Social Science.

### 2.2 Epistemology: The Nature of Knowledge

* **Positivism**: "Knowledge is only valid if it can be observed, measured, and quantified."
  * *Motto*: "If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist."
  * *Goal*: To discover universal laws (e.g., Gravity, Lapse Rate).
  * *Approach*: Survey 1000 people, run a Regression model.
* **Interpretivism**: "Knowledge comes from understanding the *meaning* people give to their lives."
  * *Motto*: "Numbers don't tell the whole story."
  * *Goal*: To understand deep, complex human experiences.
  * *Approach*: Interview 10 people in-depth.

## 3. Geographic Paradigms

Where does your research fit?

| Paradigm | Philosophy | Typical Methods | Example Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spatial Science** | Positivism | GIS, Remote Sensing, Statistics | "What is the spatial pattern of urban sprawl in Mumbai?" |
| **Humanistic** | Interpretivism | Ethnography, Interviews | "How do slum dwellers *feel* about displacement?" |
| **Critical** | Marxism/Feminism | Discourse Analysis | "Who *benefits* from the current urban planning policies?" |

## 4. Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning

* **Deductive (Top-Down)**: Theory -> Hypothesis -> Observation -> Confirmation.
  * *Usage*: Testing an existing theory. (e.g., "Testing the Urban Heat Island theory in a new city.")
* **Inductive (Bottom-Up)**: Observation -> Pattern -> Tentative Hypothesis -> Theory.
  * *Usage*: Exploring a new phenomenon. (e.g., "Observing a new disease cluster and theorizing its cause.")

## 5. Summary

Most "Google Earth Engine" research is **Positivist** and **Deductive**. We assume the Earth is real (Realism), we can measure it with satellites (Positivism), and we test hypotheses about it (Deductive). Acknowledging this bias is the mark of a mature researcher.
