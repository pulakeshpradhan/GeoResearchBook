# Part 5: References

Academic integrity is non-negotiable. You must credit the authors whose work you used.

## 1. Citation Styles

Different journals require different styles.

* **APA (American Psychological Association)**: Common in Social Sciences/Geography.
  * *Text*: (Smith, 2020)
  * *Reference*: Smith, J. (2020). *Title of Book*. Publisher.
* **Harvard**: Similar to APA.
* **IEEE**: Numbered style.
  * *Text*: [1]
  * *Reference*: 1. J. Smith, "Title of Paper," Journal Name, vol. 1, 2020.

## 2. In-text Citation

Every time you mention a fact that is not common knowledge, you cite it.
> "The Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.1°C (IPCC, 2021)."

## 3. Bibliography

The list at the end of your thesis/paper.

## 4. Reference Management Tools
