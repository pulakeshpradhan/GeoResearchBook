# Chapter 1.3: Finding Scientific Information

We live in the "Information Age", but research requires "Knowledge".

## 1. The Hierarchy of Evidence

Not all PDFs are equal.

1. **Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles**: The Gold Standard. (e.g., *Remote Sensing of Environment*, *Journal of Hydrology*). Blindly reviewed by experts.
2. **Conference Proceedings**: Faster, newer, but less rigorous. (e.g., *IGARSS*).
3. **Grey Literature**: Reports by reputable bodies (UN, IPCC, ISRO, NASA). Good for facts/data.
4. **Trade Magazines/News**: Good for context ("A flood happened yesterday"), bad for theory.
5. **Wikipedia/Blogs**: Never cite these. Use them to understand definitions, then find the original source.

## 2. Searching Like a Pro (Systematic Search)

We generally use **Boolean Operators** (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).

### The "Building Block" Strategy

Build blocks of synonyms.

* **Block A (Topic)**: `("Flood" OR "Inundation" OR "Waterlogging")`
* **Block B (Method)**: `("Remote Sensing" OR "GIS" OR "Sentinel-1" OR "SAR")`
* **Block C (Location)**: `("Urban" OR "City" OR "Mumbai")`

**Combine**: `Block A AND Block B AND Block C`
*Result*: Google Scholar will ONLY show papers that match ALL three concepts. This filters out millions of irrelevant results.

## 3. Databases

| Database | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Scholar** | Free, Huge database, Semantic search. | Full of "junk" (low quality papers), poor filtering. |
| **Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE)** | Open access focus. | Less specialized. |
| **Web of Science / Scopus** | High quality, citation analysis tools. | Expensive (University Access needed). |
| **ResearchGate** | Social networking, PDF requests. | Not a search engine per se. |

## 4. The "Snowball" Method

When you find ONE perfect paper (The "Seed"):

1. **Backward Snowball**: Look at its References. Who did *they* read? (Go to the past).
2. **Forward Snowball**: Put the title in Google Scholar and click **"Cited By"**. Who read *them*? (Come to the future).

*Tip*: If you see the same name (e.g., "Dr. Roy") appear 5 times, that person is the "Key Authority". Read everything they wrote.
