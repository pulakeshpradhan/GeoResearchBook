# Chapter 2.2: Writing the Introduction

The introduction is the most difficult part to write because it requires telling a story.

## 1. The "Hook" (Global Context)

Start with a fact that everyone agrees is important.

* *Example*: "Climate change is intensifying the frequency of hydrological extremes globally (IPCC, 2021)."
* *Purpose*: To grab the reader's attention and establish relevance.

## 2. The Problem Statement (The Gap)

Navigate from the global issue to the specific problem.

* *Global*: "Floods cause billions in damage."
* *Regional*: "In India, the Brahmaputra basin is particularly vulnerable."
* *Local (The Gap)*: "However, traditional monitoring using gauge stations is sparse and often fails during extreme events. While satellite remote sensing offers a solution, few studies have utilized the all-weather capability of Sentinel-1 SAR in this specific region."

## 3. The Research Objectives (SMART)

Don't be vague. Be precise.

* **Primary Objective**: To map the spatio-temporal extent of the 2022 floods in Assam.
* **Secondary Objectives**:
    1. To compare the flood extent with Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps.
    2. To assess the damage to agricultural land.
    3. To validate the satellite derived extent with ground reports.

## 4. The Research Questions (RQs)

Turn your objectives into questions.

* *RQ1*: What was the maximum spatial extent of inundation during the peak flood period?
* *RQ2*: Which land use class suffered the most significant areal loss?

## 5. Significance of the Study

Why should we care?

* "This study will assist disaster management authorities in identifying priority zones for relief distribution."
