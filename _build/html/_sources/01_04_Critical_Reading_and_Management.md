# Chapter 1.4: Critical Reading and Management

You have 50 PDFs. Limitless knowledge, but limited time. How do you cope?

## 1. The SQ3R Method (Adapted for Research)

Do not read sentence-by-sentence from page 1 to 10.

1. **S (Survey)**: Read the **Title** and **Abstract**. Determine: Is this relevant? If no, delete.
2. **Q (Question)**: Ask: "What did they find? How did they do it?"
3. **R (Read - Selected)**:
    * Read the **Conclusion** first. (The Answer).
    * Read the **Figures/Maps**. (The Data).
    * Read the **Methodology**. (The Recipe).
    * *Skip the Introduction* (unless you need background).
4. **R (Recite)**: Can you summarize the paper in 1 sentence?
5. **R (Review)**: Add it to your Zotero/Excel sheet.

## 2. Managing References (Zotero)

Tools like Zotero are "Reference Managers".

* **Storage**: They keep the PDF and the Metadata (Title, Author, Year) together.
* **Organization**: Use Folders (Collections) and Tags.
  * *Tags*: `#method`, `#theory`, `#important`, `#read_later`.
* **Integration**: Zotero plugs into MS Word. You press a button, it handles the comma, the bracket, the italics.

## 3. The "Critical Analysis Matrix" (Excel)

We introduced this earlier, but let's go deeper. The **"Gap"** column is vital.
Types of Gaps to look for:

1. **Geographical Gap**: "They did this in USA, but not in India."
2. **Methodological Gap**: "They used 30m Landsat, but 10m Sentinel would be better."
3. **Temporal Gap**: "They analyzed 2000-2010. We need an update for 2010-2023."
4. **Variable Gap**: "They looked at temperature but ignored humidity."

*Your thesis exists to fill one of these cells.*
