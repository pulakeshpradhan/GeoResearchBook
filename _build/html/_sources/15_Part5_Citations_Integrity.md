# Chapter 5.1: Citations and Integrity

## What is Plagiarism?

Copying someone else's work (text, map, or idea) without credit.

* **Verbatim Plagiarism**: Copy-pasting text.
* **Mosaic Plagiarism**: Changing a few words but keeping the structure.
* **Self-Plagiarism**: Re-using your own old assignment.

## Citation Styles

1. **APA (American Psychological Association)**
    * *In-text*: (Smith, 2020)
    * *Bib*: Smith, J. (2020). *Book Title*. Publisher.
2. **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)**
    * *In-text*: [1]
    * *Bib*: [1] J. Smith, *Book Title*, Publisher, 2020.

## Paraphrasing

Never Copy-Paste. Read, understand, close the PDF, and write in your own words.

* *Original*: "The cat sat on the mat."
* *Paraphrase*: "The feline was observed resting upon the rug."
