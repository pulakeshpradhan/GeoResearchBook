# Chapter 1.2: The Research Process

Research is not a linear straight line; it is an "Hourglass".

## 1. The Hourglass Model

1. **Broad Start**: "I am interested in Climate Change." (Too broad)
2. **Narrowing Down**: "I am interested in heatwaves in India."
3. **The Pinch Point (Research Question)**: "How has the surface temperature of Ahmedabad changed from 2000-2020?" (Specific)
4. **The Analysis**: Doing the work.
5. **Broadening Out (Discussion)**: "This temperature rise in Ahmedabad suggests a need for better national urban policy." (Back to broad context)

## 2. Defining a Topic (The Research Matrix)

Don't wait for inspiration. Build a matrix.

| **Variable A** (Phenomenon) | **Variable B** (Driver/Correlation) | **Location** (Context) | **Method** (Tool) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Flood Susceptibility | Land Use Change | Coastal Odisha | AHP / Machine Learning |
| Forest Fire Risk | Road Density | Himalayan Belt | Logistic Regression |
| Groundwater Depletion| Cropping Patterns | Punjab | GRACE Satellite Data |

**Mix and Match**: "Assessing [Flood Susceptibility] due to [Land Use Change] in [Coastal Odisha] using [Machine Learning]." -> *Instant Research Title.*

## 3. The "So What?" Test

Before you start, ask yourself: "If I find the answer, who cares?"

* *Weak*: "I want to map trees in my college." (Who cares? Maybe the gardener.)
* *Strong*: "I want to map trees to calculate the campus carbon sequestration potential." (Relevant to global climate goals).

## 4. Feasibility Check

A great idea is useless if it's impossible.

* **Data**: Do I have access to it? (e.g., Drone data is expensive; Sentinel-2 is free).
* **Skills**: Do I know how to do it? (Or can I learn in 2 weeks?).
* **Time**: Can this be done in 6 months? (Don't propose a 5-year longitudinal study for a Masters thesis).
* **Cost**: Do I need to buy software? (Stick to Open Source: QGIS, Python, GEE).

## 5. From Topic to Title

A scientific title should be: **[Method]** to study **[Topic]** in **[Location]**.

* *Draft 1*: " Floods in Assam."
* *Draft 2*: "Mapping floods in Assam using Satellite data."
* *Final*: "Spatiotemporal assessment of flood inundation dynamics in the Brahmaputra Basin using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR imagery."
