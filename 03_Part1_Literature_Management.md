# Chapter 1.3: Literature Management

You downloaded 50 PDFs. Now what? Do not leave them in your "Downloads" folder named "final_paper_v2.pdf".

## The "Excel Sheet" Strategy

Before writing a single word, create a "Matrix" of literature. This allows you to compare papers at a glance.

**Columns to Create:**

1. **Sl No.**: For counting.
2. **Author (Year)**: e.g., "Pradhan et al. (2024)".
3. **Title**: Full title.
4. **Study Area**: Identify if it is similar to yours (e.g., Coastal, Mountainous).
5. **Data Source**: Crucial. Did they use Landsat (30m) or Sentinel (10m)?
6. **Methodology**: What algorithm? (Random Forest, NDVI thresholding, Qualitative Survey).
7. **Findings**: The "number" they found. (e.g., "Forest decreased by 15%").
8. **Gap/Limitation**: What did they miss? (e.g., "Study was only for winter season", "Cloud cover was high").

*This "Gap" column is your golden ticket. Your research objective will be to fill one of these gaps.*

## File Naming Convention

Rename every PDF you download immediately:
`Year - Author - Short Title.pdf`
*Example*: `2023 - Smith - Urban Floods in Mumbai.pdf`
