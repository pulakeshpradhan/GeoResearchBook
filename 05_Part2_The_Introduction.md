# Chapter 2.1: The Introduction

The Introduction section sets the trajectory for your entire research paper. In high-impact journals, the introduction follows a rigid logical flow known as the **CARS Model (Creating A Research Space)**, proposed by *John Swales*.

## The CARS Model Structure

### Move 1: Establishing a Territory (The Broad Context)

Demonstrate that the general research area is important, central, or problematic.

* **Strategy**: Claim centrality.
* *Example*: "Rapid urbanization is a dominant demographic trend globally, significantly altering local climates (United Nations, 2018)."

### Move 2: Establishing a Niche (The Problem/Gap)

Indicate a gap in the previous research or extend prior knowledge. This justifies *why* your study is needed.

* **Types of Gaps**:
    1. **Geographic Gap**: "While UHI has been studied in temperate regions, few studies focus on tropical monsoon climates."
    2. **Methodological Gap**: "Previous studies relied on low-resolution MODIS data, overlooking neighborhood-level thermal variations."
    3. **Temporal Gap**: "Most studies analyze summer heat, neglecting winter warming trends."
* *Phrasing*: "However, little is known about...", "It remains unclear whether..."

### Move 3: Occupying the Niche (The Objective)

Outline the purposive nature of your study to fill the identified gap.

* **Strategy**: State the objective clearly.
* *Example*: "Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of LST in Delhi using high-resolution Landsat 8 imagery."

## Research Questions & Hypotheses

A scientific study must ask specific questions.

| Research Question (RQ) | Hypothesis ($H_0$ / $H_1$) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **RQ1**: How has the vegetation cover changed in the last 20 years? | $H_1$: Vegetation cover has significantly declined due to urban expansion. |
| **RQ2**: Is there a relationship between vegetation density (NDVI) and temperature (LST)? | $H_1$: There is a statistically significant negative correlation ($Newative$) between NDVI and LST. |

*(Note: In rigorous science, we test the Null Hypothesis $H_0$, which usually states "There is no relationship," and try to reject it.)*
