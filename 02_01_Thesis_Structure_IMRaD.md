# Chapter 2.1: The Anatomy of a Thesis (IMRaD)

A scientific thesis is not a novel; it is a technical report. It must follow a rigid structure known as **IMRaD**.

## 1. What is IMRaD?

It stands for **Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion**.

* **Introduction**: *Why* did you do it? (The Problem).
* **Methods**: *How* did you do it? (The Recipe).
* **Results**: *What* did you find? (The Facts).
* **Discussion**: *So what* does it mean? (The Interpretation).

## 2. The Logic Flow

Think of your thesis as an Hourglass (again).

1. **Introduction**: Broad -> Narrow. (World -> Your Study Area).
2. **Methods**: Narrow. (Specific steps).
3. **Results**: Narrow. (Specific numbers).
4. **Discussion**: Narrow -> Broad. (Your numbers -> Global implications).

## 3. Title and Abstract (The First Impressions)

* **Title**: Must be descriptive. Formula: `[Variable] + [Location] + [Method]`.
  * *Bad*: "A Study on Water."
  * *Good*: "Assessment of Groundwater Quality in Chennai using GIS-based Water Quality Index (WQI)."
* **Abstract**: A mini-thesis (250 words).
  * Sentence 1: Background.
  * Sentence 2: Objective.
  * Sentence 3: Methodology.
  * Sentence 4: Key Result.
  * Sentence 5: Conclusion/Implication.

## 4. Keywords

These are the "Hashtags" of science. Choose 5-6 words that will help people find your paper on Google Scholar.

* *Example*: Urban Heat Island, Remote Sensing, Landsat, Land Surface Temperature, Sustainable Cities.
