# Part 4: Interpretation and Conclusion

After the analysis (Part 3), you have maps and numbers. Now you must explain what they *mean*.

## 1. Interpretation

Do not just repeat the numbers.

* **Weak**: "Forest cover was 100 sq km in 2000 and 80 sq km in 2020."
* **Strong**: "The analysis reveals a **20% decline** in forest cover over two decades. This significant loss is primarily concentrated along the northern highway, suggesting that **road infrastructure expansion** is a key driver of deforestation in this region."

**Support with Literature**:
> "This finding aligns with Smith (2019), who also observed a correlation between road density and forest loss in the Amazon."

## 2. Using Visuals

* **Maps**: Ensure they have a North Arrow, Scale Bar, and Legend.
* **Charts**: Use Bar charts for comparison, Line charts for trends (time-series).
* **Tables**: Use tables for exact statistical values.

## 3. Conclusion

The conclusion summarizes everything.

* Restate the Objective.
* Summarize the main findings (e.g., "The UHI effect raised temperatures by 4°C").
* Implications (e.g., "City planners should increase green cover").
* Future Scope (e.g., "Future studies could use higher resolution drone data").
