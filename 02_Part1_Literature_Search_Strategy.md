# Chapter 1.2: Literature Search Strategy

A robust literature review is the foundation of any high-impact research paper. It ensures your work is novel and grounded in existing science.

## Sources of Scientific Literature

Differentiate between "Grey Literature" and "Peer-Reviewed Literature".

### 1. Primary Databases (Peer-Reviewed)

* **Web of Science (WoS)**: The gold standard for scientific citation indexing.
* **Scopus**: Extensive coverage of scientific journals.
* **Google Scholar**: The most accessible entry point. Tips:
  * Use the **"Cite"** button to export references.
  * Use the **"Related articles"** link to find similar work.
* **Scientific Repositories**: NASA ADS, IEEE Xplore (for remote sensing).

### 2. Secondary Sources (Grey Literature)

* Government Reports (IPCC, Census of India, ISRO Reports).
* Theses and Dissertations (Shodhganga).
* *Note*: Use these for data and context, but rely on journals for theory.

## Advanced Search Strategy (Systematic Review)

Do not search randomly. Use a **Systematic Search Strategy**.

### The Keyword Matrix

Break your topic into concepts and synonyms.

| Concept 1: Topic | Concept 2: Method | Concept 3: Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Urban Heat Isand" | "Remote Sensing" | "India" |
| "Land Surface Temperature" | "Landsat" | "Megacity" |
| "LST" | "Google Earth Engine" | "Delhi" |

### Boolean Logic (The Standard Syntax)

Combine synonyms with **OR** and concepts with **AND**.

**Search String Example**:

```text
("Urban Heat Island" OR "Land Surface Temperature" OR "LST") 
AND 
("Remote Sensing" OR "Satellite" OR "Landsat" OR "MODIS") 
AND 
("India" OR "Developing Cities")
```

### The "Snowballing" Technique

1. **Forward Snowballing**: Find a key paper (e.g., *Weng, 2009*) and look at who cited it *after* 2009. This connects you to newer research.
2. **Backward Snowballing**: Read the reference list of a key paper to find the older, foundational studies.
